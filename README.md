# HTTPS4All

This app rewrites HTTP hosts to HTTPS in iOS Safari using a 'Content Blocker'. The host list it uses is generated by the [https-everywhere-host-list](https://github.com/bouk/https-everywhere-host-list) tool. This tool utilizes the host list from [HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/efforg/https-everywhere/).
